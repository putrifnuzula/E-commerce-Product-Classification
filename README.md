# E-commerce-Product-Classification
A text classification model to categorizes product label from an e-commerce.
# Overview:
- Data preprossesing: data cleaning, encode the 'label' variable, data splitting.
- Employ two different text representation methods which are TF-IDF and Word2Vec.
- Build a predictive model using two different algorithm, SVM and Random Forest.
- Tuning Hyperparameters: Leveraging GridSearchCV to optimize both model.
- Compare and Analyse the predictive results.
